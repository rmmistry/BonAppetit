Share your passion for cooking with Bon Appetit. Bon Appetit is a versatile, flexible and on-the-go  platform for users to store, organize, customize and share their favorite recipes with family and friends via weblink. It allows users to dynamically add rows for ingredient information. This app allows users to search recipes with ingredient name, recipe title or relevant keyword from anywhere. Bon Appetit translates the query into a list of recipes and then users can view details for the recipe of their choice, which includes title, ingredient, image, cook time, prep time, total time and preparation. Users can also modify serving size and Bon Appetit will update the ingredientâ€™s quantity, thus eliminating any guesswork. This will serve as a recipe book vault for novice and experienced users.
